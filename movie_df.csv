Baadasssss!,7.3,4.9K,49,78,Biography;Drama,"Melvin Van Peebles stunned the world for the first time, with his debut feature, The Story of a Three Day Pass. Filmed in France and selected as the French entry in the San Francisco Film Festival, Melvin's film was awarded the top prize. Saying it was controversial would be an understatement. In 1968 for a black man to walk up to the podium and accept the top festival award for a film he had to go abroad to make--now that's how you make your mark. After his comedy, Watermelon Man, Melvin was determined to push the Hollywood boundaries with the groundbreaking, and even more controversial, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. Turned down by every major studio including Columbia, where he had a three-picture deal, Melvin was forced to basically self-finance. Risking everything he had, Melvin delivered to the world the first Black Ghetto hero on the big screen--whether they were ready or not. More than 30 years later, history is being fashioned again in the telling of this very tale. Mario Van Peebles, Melvin's son, directs an honest and revealing portrait of his pioneering father. Mario now tells the story of the making of Melvin Van Peebles' landmark 1971 film, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, including Melvin's struggles to raise money to fund the film under the guise of creating a black porno film. Melvin had ducked creditors, the unions and had to bail out his camera crew after they were arrested because a white cop decided a bunch of Negroes and hippies couldn't have come by that camera equipment honestly. Despite death threats and temporarily losing sight in one eye, Melvin somehow managed to whip into shape a rag-tag, multi-racial crew and finish the film that would give birth to birth of a new era which was about to explode: Independent Black Cinema.",homage;archive footage;film in film;movie producer;movie director;underdog;racism;prejudice;filmmaking;african american;1970s;timeframe 1970s;black man;box office;movie theatre patron;movie theater;watching a movie;quarrel;movie production;movie set;movie camera;16mm camera;see through gown;black woman;film production;revolver;interview;body paint;single parent;cameo;porn producer;voice actor;voice over narration;written and directed by cast member;father son relationship;blaxploitation;interracial relationship;based on true story;breasts;rape;scene during end credits;pubic hair;female pubic hair;bare butt;male rear nudity;cigar smoking;bare chested male;see through clothes;nudity;female full frontal nudity;female nudity;question in title;punctuation in title;apostrophe in title;profanity in title

Galaxy Quest,7.4,161K,721,107,Adventure;Comedy;Sci-Fi,"The sci-fi television series ""Galaxy Quest"", which took place aboard the intergalactic spaceship NSEA Protector, starred Jason Nesmith as suave Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, Gwen DeMarco as sexy communications person Lt. Tawny Madison (a role which consisted solely of repeating what the computer stated, much to Gwen's chagrin), Shakespearean trained Sir Alexander Dane as alien Dr. Lazarus, Fred Kwan as engineer Tech Sergeant Chen, and Tommy Webber as child pilot Laredo. Eighteen years after the series last aired, it lives on in the hearts of its rabid fans. However, it lives on in infamy for its stars, who have not been able to find meaningful acting work since. Their current lives revolve around cashing in on however those roles will afford, which usually entails attending fan conventions or worse, such as electronic store openings. Only Jason seems to relish his lot in life, until he finds out that his co-stars detest him because of his superior attitude as ""the Commander"", and much of the public considers him a laughing stock. Their lives change when Jason is approached by who he thinks are convention fans asking for help. They are in reality an alien race called Thermians, led by Mathesar, who have modeled their existence after the series, which they believe to be real. When Jason and then the rest of his co-stars (along with Guy Fleegman, who was killed off before the opening credits in only one episode) go along with the Thermians, Jason's co-stars who believe they are off to yet another paying gig, they learn that they have to portray their roles for real. Without screenwriters to get them to a happy and heroic ending, they have to trust that their play acting will work, especially in dealing with the Thermians' nemesis, General Sarris. Guy in particular fears that he will go the way his character did on the series. But when they run across technical issues that they as actors didn't care anything about during the filming of the series and thus now don't know how to deal with, they need to find someone who should know what to do.",parody;sexy woman;alien;actor;fanboy;shapeshifting;desert;hologram;monster;naivety;mistaken identity;cult film;spoof;male alien;time bomb;sci fi parody;fan the person;evil man;fictional celebrity;filmed in utah;liar revealed;tubi tv;time machine;time traveler;backwards time travel;male time traveler;first contact;male protagonist;dreamworks;satirical;title directed by male;title directed by man;title written by male;alien abduction;alien disguised as a woman;alien love interest;sexy alien;sexy female alien;slimehouse;space sci fi;space adventure;timeframe 1990s;high concept comedy;parody comedy;sci fi comedy;catchphrase;convention;alien race;general;spaceship;commander;television;star;costume;starship interior;alien villain;earthling;female alien;female humanoid alien;humanoid alien;human in outer space;screw;saucer separation sequence;restroom;crash landing;shot to death;computer cracker;murder;shot in the chest;elevator;villain not really dead cliche;shapeshifting alien;exploding ship;showdown;warp speed;brawl;fight;fistfight;blockbuster;explosive decompression;race against time;chase;revelation;hostage;kidnapping;escape;rescue;exploding body;blood splatter;green blood;scientist;interrogation;macguffin;transformation;spaceport;escape pod;deception;bare chested male;planet;englishman;good versus evil;minefield;laser gun;gunfight;shootout;sphere;artificial intelligence;super computer;internet;news report;wormhole;giant;creature;teleportation;flying car;limousine;fictional war;space battle;swimming pool;drunkenness;title appears in writing;actress;spacecraft;1990s;male female relationship;star trek parody;giant scissors;prologue;parallel universe;oxygen;has been;extraterrestrial;egotist;child actor;urination;sci fi spoof;satire;outer space;unlikely hero;starship;space war;space travel;battle;explosion;shot in the back;torture;time travel;ribbon cutting;makeup;kiss;innocence;hangover;fireworks;egotism;crutch;autograph;hero;fandom;idol;star trek spoof;celebrity has been;alien love;title spoken by character;surprise ending;male objectification;matronizing;passive aggressive behavior;passive aggressive woman

Big Miracle,6.5,20K,77,114,Biography;Drama;Family,"October, 1988. Adam Carlson, a reporter for a local Anchorage television station, is currently in Barrow doing a series of pieces on the ""local cultural color"" of northern Alaska. While out on the sea ice filming a less than promising piece, he spots off in the distance what ends up being three California gray whales - a mother, father and son - who are literally imprisoned by ice which has surrounded them in the earlier than usual onset of winter. They are looking worse for wear as they have been ramming the ice surface to maintain a hole in the ice to be able to breathe and thus survive. The professional and cultural assessment he receives is that the whales, in their current situation, cannot survive for more than a few days, with the ice fives miles in distance to the open ocean with a vertical ice shelf that has developed midway. Adam's piece on the whales not only gets played on his station, but is picked up by news services throughout the States, including the national broadcasters, which brings the plight of the whales to the attention of various different groups. First and foremost is Greenpeace, Anchorage-based Rachel Kramer in particular who will do anything to save the whales, she who happens to be Adam's ex-girlfriend the two having parted on not good terms. Rachel tries to manipulate those who can do something to do those somethings. Those groups include the governor's office, who she wants to request deployment of the National Guard specifically to transport via helicopter tow a privately owned hoverbarge capable of breaking through the ice. The problem for Rachel is that the hoverbarge is owned by her mortal enemy, J.W. McGraw of Alaskan Northern Oil, which wants drilling rights in the northern waters. More and more news services send their reporters to Barrow to cover the story, including Los Angeles based Jill Jerard after who Adam has long lusted from afar. The White House gets wind of the story, support for the whales which they are determined to demonstrate, as public support grows, that White House support especially important in an election year. And the local indigenous group, the Inupiat, initially plan to harvest the whales in their certain death in an effort to protect their natural hunting/fishing way of life, despite the gray whale specifically not being part of their natural diet.",whale;alaska;save the whale;based on true story;ice;snow;snowstorm;dog;animal;brother sister relationship;the white house;young boy;reference to greenpeace;snow mobile;watching tv;reference to the national guard;new york;reference to michael dukakis;airplane;airport;parka;sled dog;boulder colorado;reference to a hippie;young girl;preteen boy;los angeles california;barrow alaska;national guard;harpoon;reference to guns and roses;dog sled team;mexican restaurant;scuba gear;scuba diver;tv interview;grandfather grandson relationship;headphones;sony walkman;reference to ronald reagan;reference to the minnesota vikings;playing scrabble;scrabble;reference to gordon gekko;reference to minneapolis minnesota;reference to the minnesota north stars;classroom;reading a school essay aloud;talking on the phone;reference to george h.w. bush;year 1988;timeframe 1980s;volunteer;reporter;small town;arctic circle;greenpeace;animal rescue;reference to superman;1980s;business executive;death of an animal;tv reporter;rescue;helicopter;environmentalism;public relations;whaling;native american;scuba diving;icebreaker;opportunism;idealism;ecology;ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship

"You, Me and the Apocalypse",7.6,7.4K,42,6,Comedy;Drama;Sci-Fi,"Comedy drama about the final days of mankind. Mild-mannered Slough Bank Manager Jamie (Mathew Baynton) is in a rut - albeit a very organized one - consumed by grief for his missing wife. All of that soon changes, however, when he's arrested on suspicion of cyber terrorism and realizes that, somehow, he must have an identical twin, and that his mum Paula (Pauline Quirke) has some serious explaining to do. Halfway around the world in New Mexico, unassuming librarian Rhonda (Jenna Fischer) enters a maximum-security prison for a crime she didn't commit, and reluctantly falls under the wing of unhinged white supremacist Leanne (Megan Mullally). At the Vatican, meanwhile, foul-mouthed rebel Priest Father Jude (Rob Lowe) interviews the beautiful Sister Celine (Gaia Scodellaro) for a role in his office of the Devil's Advocate. These are just some of the eclectic and seemingly unconnected characters whose lives will start to intersect in the most unexpected ways as news breaks that a comet is on an unavoidable collision course towards Earth and will hit in just thirty-four days. Some of them are destined to make it to a bunker deep beneath the suburbs of Slough and, as a result, will become the hugely unlikely (and, frankly, somewhat unsuitable) future of mankind.",tv mini series;apocalypse;race against time;actor playing dual role;protagonist and antagonist played by same actor;brothers played by same actor;twin brothers played by same actor;twin brother;twin brothers;twin;twins;family relationships;dysfunctional family;best friend;friend;friendship between men;friendship;male friendship;investigation;private investigation;interracial relationship;boyfriend boyfriend relationship;gay;gay character;gay couple;f rated;strong female;strong female character;strong female characters;roommate;roommate roommate relationship;flashback;14 year old boy;flash forward;hacker;survival;conspiracy theory;conspiracy theorist;coworker coworker relationship;christianity;christian;multiple protagonists;criminal;wrongfully accused;on the run;woman on the run;teenage boy;teenager;14 year old;female criminal;mistaken identity;identity crisis;identity;racist;racist woman;american racism;american nationalism;american nationalist;nationalist;nationalism;secret mission;xenophobia;xenophobe;xenophobic woman;african american;husband wife relationship;estrangement;redneck;comet;vatican;missing wife;priest;end of the world;voice over narration;ambulance;told in flashback;female convict;prison escape;computer hacker;adopted son;adoption;england;underground;vatican city;laptop computer;interrogation room;police arrest;surveillance;surveillance van;nun;convent;news report;end of the world scenario;mother son relationship;swastika tattoo;women's prison;five word title;punctuation in title

The 33,6.9,38K,95,134,Biography;Drama;History,"A docudramatic account of the 2010 Chilean mine disaster is presented, where the thirty-three miners who went into the San José Mine in Copiapó, Chile in the middle of the Atacama Desert on August 5 were trapped 700 meters underground for sixty-nine days, with all thirty-three eventually able to make it out of the mine alive. That day, mine foreman, Luis ""Don Lucho"" Urzúa, reported his concerns to mine owner, Carlos Castillo, about the unstable nature of the mountain under which the mine is located, those concerns which went unheeded. Don Lucho one of the thirty-three, went to work as usual into the mine, when that instability led to collapse in some of the underground shafts, the thirty-three who were able to make it to the refuge area, however with communication channels to the surface inoperable. Under normal circumstances, the refuge area had enough supplies to last thirty men three days. The miners also discovered that the company had failed to place the requisite ladders from the refuge area to the surface, and that the primary route out was now blocked by a shifted rock, its mass the equivalent of the Empire State Building. The thirty-three were ultimately led by Mario Sepúlveda, who was not going to let any of the thirty-three take priority over any of the others, especially in the initial panic and instinct for self-survival among some. On the surface, loved ones of the trapped miners held vigil at the mine, with María Segovia, elder sister of trapped miner Dario Segovia, arguably the most outspoken in condemnation of the powers that be not doing anything to search for the miners, not knowing if they were dead or alive, but who was also quick to give praise where praise was due. That praise largely went to the relatively new Minister of Mines, Laurence Golborne, who was determined both to do whatever he could on behalf of the government to look for the men and to provide accurate assessments to those holding vigil of the situation, especially in Castillo seeing miner deaths solely as an unfortunate nature of the business. The chief engineer assigned to drill toward the refuge area in the hopes that the miners were there was Andre Sougarret, who admitted that the process was not a scientific one as one would have hoped. Once the miners were discovered alive in the refuge area, the next phase of trying to extract them held its own new challenges for all concerned, both logistical and emotional.",survival;rescue;latin america;street vendor;working class;earthquake;cave in;panic;buried alive;hard hat;ruckus;politician;food rationing;news broadcast;bare chested male;mining engineer;near miss;despair;contemplating suicide;rescue operation;anger;empanada;employer employee relationship;miner;mine foreman;number;south america;watching tv;woman slaps a man;disaster action;disaster drama;mine;race against time;docudrama;disaster film;trapped in a mine;trapped underground;chile;based on true story;title directed by female;ore cart;survival film;minister;president;mining;underground shaft;year 2010;mine shaft;chile northern

Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items.

The Big Short,7.8,410K,634,488,Biography;Comedy;Drama,"Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old ""friend"", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.",mortgage;finance;bank;banking;short selling;subprime mortgage;credit default swap;mortgage backed security;loan;accounting fraud;financial crisis;goldman sachs;wall street manhattan new york city;fraud;economics;tranche;subprime loan;financial market;business failure;manhattan new york city;bear stearns;stripper;morgan stanley wealth management;based on true story;conflict of interest;las vegas nevada;arm;bond;wall street;blonde;strip club;female nudity;nudity;adjustible rate mortgage;woman in a bubble bath;cheerleader;political corruption;money falling through the air;standard and poor's credit rating agency;reference to mark twain;new york city;home loan;breaking the fourth wall by talking to the audience;financier;employer employee relationship;animated sequence;abandoned house;inner title card;reference to william ernest henley;reference to adam smith;ensemble cast;essay film;rolex watch;rolex submariner;woman in a bathtub;woman wears pasties;autism spectrum;asperger syndrome;breaking the fourth wall;financial derivative;corruption;wall street corruption;wall street banker;financial investor;hedge fund;hedge fund manager;eccentric man;wall street crash;reference to michael jordan;historical drama;timeframe 2000s;workplace drama;housing market;morgan stanley;ends with historical notes;reference to ben bernanke;talking to the camera;reference to muhammad ali;reference to george foreman;makeshift tent;haruki murakami quotation;drum set;stretch limousine;shooting gallery;caesar's palace las vegas;american securitization forum;reference to warren buffett;bragging;reference to henry 'hank' merritt paulson jr.;hot hand fallacy;sublet;synthetic cdo;alligator;analogy;isda agreement;jp morgan chase;collateralized debt obligation;wrong number;deutsche bank;death of brother;suicide;epididymis;shorting stock;hundred dollar bill;jewish;drinking champagne in a bath;risk;group therapy;swimming laps;football;bundling;year 1933;prosthetic eye;begins with a mark twain quotation;narrated by character;bank failure;moral hazard;systemic risk;financial cartel;financial scandal;financial disaster;financial crime;bond market;financial system;fire sector;investor class;bailout;plutocracy;white collar crime;systemic failure;illegality;criminality;financial fraud;economic recession;economic crisis;financial crash;profit motive;business interest;stock market;reference to alan greenspan;year 2008;year 2007;blackjack;corporate crime;bespoke tranche opportunity;ends with biographical notes;no opening credits;death of father

And the top rated anchor man in the city is Ron Burgundy. He enjoys his run at the top, and has for the last five years. And his news team is equally as good as he is. Professional jock and former professional baseball player Champ Kind handles the sports, the curiously dim witted Brick Tamland - who's a few channels short of a cable subscription - handles the weather, and ladies' man Brian Fantana - whose collection of fine scents would be in the Guinness Book Of Records - handles the on-field reporting. But now all that is about to change forever. The TV station Burgundy works for, Channel 4, has embraced diversity and has hired a beautiful new female anchor named Veronica Corningstone. While Ron Burgundy and the rest of the Channel 4 news team enjoys fighting with competitors, drinking, and flirting with the ladies, Veronica quietly climbs her way to the top. And Veronica's success drives Ron Burgundy crazy. So much that Veronica's meddling causes Ron to get demoted and ultimately lose his job with Channel 6. Now left with nothing, Ron must find a way to get back to the top - and that involves a story about a rare Chinese panda giving birth on US soil.

He has no real friends and spends most of his time away from work by himself. Despite having an interest in the opposite sex philosophically as witnessed by his constant and uncontrollable morning erections, he is still a virgin. He never planned not to have sex, but it became more and more difficult to have that first experience as he got older, to the point where, to him, it became a reality for his life. When his work colleagues find out, some mock and ridicule him, while a small group comprised of Dave, Jay and Cal take it upon themselves to help him get laid, despite each of three having their own relationship issue making them perhaps not the best people to provide advice or assistance. Andy also gets some unexpected suggestions from some standing on the sidelines of his life. Beyond that advice, Andy has to be the one to take the ultimate step to reality, he not only having no practical experience, but also no theoretical experience in that he doesn't even watch or have interest in porn or masturbate. Some of the advice he receives centers on the actual woman who should be his first time. Regardless of that advice, he decides that the woman he truly wants is Trish, a specialty retailer with a somewhat useless bricks and mortar outlet across the street from the electronics store.

In the days leading up to the ceremony, Don Pedro, with the help of Leonato, Claudio and Hero, attempts to sport with Benedick and Beatrice in an effort to trick the two into falling in love. Meanwhile, the villainous Don John, with the help of his allies Conrade (Riki Lindhome) and Borachio (Spencer Treat Clark), plots against the happy couple, using his own form of trickery to try to destroy the marriage before it begins.

Angry Birds,6.3,89K,234,193,Animation;Action;Adventure,"In the 3D animated comedy, The Angry Birds Movie, we'll finally find out why the birds are so angry. The movie takes us to an island populated entirely by happy, flightless birds - or almost entirely.

Nat, a marketing company manager, is more professional and controlled. Josh, a novelist with a current case of writer's block, is more carefree and childlike. Nine months into their marriage, Nat and Josh have their first session with arguably the most distracted marriage counselor in the city, that session which may be the deciding factor in whether they continue in being husband and wife to each other. Their issues over the preceding nine months are told in flashback, and include little idiosyncrasies which annoy the other, and tensions with each's in-laws, beyond the general differences in their personalities. But what may be the biggest threat to a happily-ever-after for them as a couple may be temptations with others to who, at least on paper, each is more well suited. For Nat, that temptation is client Guy Harrap, an American manufacturer who, unknown to Nat, hired her firm solely in his personal attraction to her. For Josh, that temptation is his old girlfriend Chloe, an aide worker who only recently reentered his life after a four year stint away working in Africa, the two of them in theory never having really broken up in the first place.",female stockinged legs;black pantyhose;pantyhose;pubic hair;female nudity;male nudity;male pubic hair;infidelity;cheating wife;swinger;swingers;open marriage;thong;marital problem;camera shot of feet;sexuality;lingerie;underwear;married couple;marriage;sexual humor;ex girlfriend;husband wife relationship;man wears eyeglasses;writer;doctor;reference to divorce;charades;one year anniversary;reference to role play sex;cunnilingus;fellatio;male full frontal nudity;hand job;wedding reception;scene during closing credits;montage;friend;couple;toilet;bathroom;laptop computer;bouquet;black comedy;embarrassment;american abroad;awkwardness;best friend;best man;in laws;wedding ceremony;singing in a car;claim in title;first person title
